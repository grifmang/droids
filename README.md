Childhood game, originally written in BASIC for VAX Cluster machines, remade in Python and now also playable on the web.

## Week 1 Delivered (Terminal)

- Refactored into a game engine + game state model for cleaner logic separation.
- Added safe teleport (`t`) with limited charges and risky teleport (`r`) with unlimited use.
- Added deterministic seeded runs (`--seed`).
- Added local high score persistence (`highscores.json`).

### Run terminal game

```bash
python3 game.py
```

Useful options:

```bash
python3 game.py --seed 1234 --board-size 20 --safe-teleports 3
```

### Terminal controls

- You are `@`.
- Enemies are `X`.
- Wrecks are `*`.
- Move using:

```
q w e
a . d
z s c
```

- `.` waits in place.
- `t` safe teleport (limited uses).
- `r` risky teleport (unlimited).
- `x` quits.

## Week 2 Delivered (Web)

- Added browser implementation under `web/` with keyboard controls.
- Added daily challenge mode (date-based deterministic seed).
- Added share card generation (creates an image preview from current run).

### Run web game

```bash
cd web
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open: <http://localhost:8000>

### Web controls

- Use keyboard: `qwe/asd/zxc`, `.` to wait, `t` safe teleport, `r` risky teleport.
- Use buttons for **New Run**, **Daily Challenge**, and **Share Result**.


## Week 3 Delivered (Web TypeScript)

- Migrated web game logic to TypeScript modules: `engine.ts`, `ui.ts`, `share.ts`.
- Added unit tests for enemy movement, collision resolution, and safe teleport filtering.
- Added localStorage-backed web highscores and daily streak history.
- Added accessibility polish: visible focus rings, reduced-motion toggle, and ARIA live status updates.

### TypeScript source-of-truth policy

- `web/*.ts` files are the source of truth for web game logic.
- `web/*.js` files are checked-in build artifacts generated by `npm run build:web` for direct browser loading.
- Any PR that changes `web/*.ts` must regenerate and commit matching `web/*.js` outputs to prevent drift.

### Web development checks

```bash
npm run build:web
npm test
```
